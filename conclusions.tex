\section{Conclusions}

TBW, perhaps starting with braindumps.

obviously: going from generic (bytes) to structured (formats) to
disciplinary (data models) means decreasing ease of federation (anyone
can deal with raw storage, far fewer with, say, FITS files, and still
fewer with XYFITS from radio interferometry).  At the same time, the
utility of federation decreases (anyone can use raw storage, fewer
people will want to read astronomical tables, still fewer will have
reason to analyse visibilities).  Hence, fortunately what is most easy
to federate also promises the highest return, and that is probably
what we should start with.

But what about archive services: Do we want interoperable resource/data
collection discovery across disciplines?  And if so, why and how?  See
https://github.com/msdemlei/cross-discipline-discovery for drafts of
user stories.
